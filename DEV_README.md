# README.md

Consists of two applications:

- [api](./api/): Python backend that serves the APIs
- [front](./front/): Vue frontend

**Currently, the frontend is embedded in the `api` application via the [static](./api/app/static/) folder.**

## API Application

### Pin `requirements.txt` and `dev-requirements.txt` for reproductible builds

```bash
pip install pip-tools && \
pip-compile \
      -o requirements.txt \
      pyproject.toml && \
pip-compile \
      --extra dev \
      -o dev-requirements.txt \
      pyproject.toml
```

### Installation for local development

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -r dev-requirements.txt -e .
```

### Database model and migration

The application uses its own tables. It uses alembic for db migration and infers the db location from the `BACKEND` address.
It uses a specific schema named `ocm` and should not interfere with other schema during migration.

*The application performs a db migration at startup*

#### Create a migration with alembic

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "migration name" # online revision creation
```

### CLI

[typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) is used to provide a CLI interface. See [CLI package](./api/src/our_celery_manager/app/cli) for sources.
Also [pyproject.toml](./api/pyproject.toml) defines a script bound to `ocm-cli` letting use commands like:

```bash
ocm-cli --help
```

### Generate TypeScript client

Start the API locally and run the following command:

```fish
# âš  this is fish shell
cd front/
rm -rf src/generated
docker run --rm --network="host" --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v (pwd)":/local" openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \
        -i http://host.docker.internal:8000/openapi.json \
        -g typescript-fetch \
        -p modelPropertyNaming=original \
        -o /local/src/generated/api
```

### Frontend Application

Located in the [front](./front/) folder.

It is a Vue application that uses [https://primevue.org/](https://https://primevue.org/) as a UI framework.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci
```

```bash
# For development
npm run dev
# To install the frontend in static files of API
npm run build
```

### Setup a simple development environment

Go to the [examples](./examples/composes/) folder and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## TODO:

- [x] Improve table
- [x] Append hash to static resources.
- [ ] Order is lost during sorting.
- [x] <strike>Timezone configurable on dates.</strike> Apply correct timezone to date_done.
- [ ] Filter by day or date range.
- [ ] Select and add in bulk.
- [x] Know the maximum number of pages.
- [ ] Task hierarchy
  - [ ] Currently not possible as the parent id is not persisted: [issue](https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/5824)
